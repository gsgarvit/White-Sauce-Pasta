Expert Tips

Stirring and mixing flour: 
After you add the flour, you need to keep on stirring often so that lumps are not formed. Frequently stirring the flour also cooks the flour evenly. You will notice the flour frothing and bubbling when you sauté it. You have to sauté flour until you get a nice nutty aroma and the flour gets a pale golden color.

White sauce free of lumps:
 To make a lump-free sauce, use cold milk. Hot, warm or milk at room temperature may cause lumps in the sauce.
Checking doneness of white sauce: When you see that the sauce coats the back of the spoon, it has thickened well.

For a cheese sauce:
 Add 2 tablespoons of freshly grated cheddar cheese for a cheesy white sauce. You can add 1 tablespoon of grated vegetarian parmesan cheese.

Herbs & Veggies:
 You can add both fresh herbs and dried herbs of your choice. When you add the herbs, you can also add steamed, roasted or sautéed veggies.

Gluten-free options:
 Make the same recipe with a gluten-free pasta and use rice flour or a gluten-free flour for the white sauce.

Vegan options:
 Almond milk works very nicely in the recipe. Just cook almond milk on a low heat so that it does not split or becomes grainy.
